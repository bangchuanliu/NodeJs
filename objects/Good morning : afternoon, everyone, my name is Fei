Good morning (afternoon), everyone, my name is Fei Chen. I got my bachelor degree in computer science and technology at AnHui University in 2006. As soon as I graduated from university, I joined BeiJing Si-Tech information technology company, I have been working there for ten years, currently, I'm the department manager of Mobile.
I'm very glad that I'm getting the chance being recommended to apply master candidate in software engineering of USTC. in addition, this is a new start and challenge for me.
I really appreciate and cherish this opportunity and study very hard, hopefully, there would be a good result for my interview.
in a nutshell, I sincerely hope that I could study in USTC and get improvement. Thank you.
